###Description
An app written in swift to record and execute a handful of linear optimization algorithms with the ability to select certain variables. Afterward you can see your results, informational graphs, and compare your results to running on our server.

###Prerequisites
* XCode 6
* Cocoapods

###Installation
* Clone or copy project to computer
* Run `pod install`
* Open `OptimizationAnalysis.xcworkspace` and **NOT** `OptimizationAnalysis.xcodeproj`

###Usage
* Choose to run the algorithm on the `App`, the `Api` (server) or `Both`
* Pick the type of algorithm you would like to run, the fit function to use and fill in the parameters how you'd like
* Click `Run` and when your algorithms are done executing, you will be moved to the **Results** screen, where you can view your results and select graphs to view
